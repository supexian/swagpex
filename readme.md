## Things that I will consider adding in the near future:
+ Improvised Player / Country Inspector (NY)
+ A Cool Resource Trading thingamajig that will prevent your nation to go debt and byebye. (NY)
+ Automatic Country Picker, probably configurable on the Config. Useful for new servers to prevent noobs from ruling your dream nation. (NY)
